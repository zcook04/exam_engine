- Overused global redux state for exam.  State bled into contribute portion and needed to be dialed back as it was causing bugs across seperate pages. Should limit use of global 
    state and use local props / state when it makes sense to do so.  The state being imported into most components made it harder to reuse those smaller components in other parts
    of the project when I needed them.

- Created the search exam component with limited foresight.  I needed it to be resuable for the flashcard search component and should have built it that way from the start.  Instead
    I resolved to copy/pasting then modifying code.  This can be reworked in the future but better planning could have prevented this entirely.  I knew I wanted a flashcard search 
    component, and it should not have been difficult for me to plan for its reuse.

- When dispatching using different imported dispatchers non-unique names will cause issues.  This is due to all of the unique dipatches being combined with the combineReducer function.
    Using the types file, I should not reuse variables in different actions/dispatchers.
